# Spin The Wheel Plug### 4. **Plugin Activat### 6. **Double Hook Registration**
**Problem**: Plugin class was registering `plugins_loaded` hook from within a `plugins_loaded` callback.

**Solution**: 
- Removed redundant `plugins_loaded` hook from Plugin constructor
- Plugin now initializes immediately when instantiated since it's already in the correct context

### 7. **Enhanced Error Handling and Debugging**ure**
**Problem**: Activator class was trying to use singleton classes during activation before the plugin infrastructure was fully loaded.

**Solutions**:
- Modified `Activator::create_default_settings()` to use native WordPress `get_option()`/`update_option()` instead of Database singleton
- Updated version checking methods to use constants instead of Config singleton during activation
- Added comprehensive error logging for debugging

### 5. **ThemeSelector Database Instantiation Error**
**Problem**: ThemeSelector component was trying to instantiate Database class directly instead of using singleton pattern.

**Solution**: 
- Changed `new Database()` to `Database::instance()` in ThemeSelector constructor
- Fixed `Call to private AhnabShahin\SpinTheWheel\System\Database::__construct()` error

### 6. **Double Hook Registration**e Resolution Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Fatal Error: `stw_init_plugin` function not found**
**Problem**: The main plugin file had a namespace declaration that moved all functions into a namespace instead of the global namespace.

**Solution**: 
- Removed namespace declaration from `spin-the-wheel.php`
- Updated Plugin class references to use fully qualified namespaces
- Functions like `stw_init_plugin()` are now in global namespace as expected by WordPress

### 2. **PSR-4 Autoloading Warnings**
**Problem**: Incorrect class names and node_modules files were causing autoloader conflicts.

**Solutions**:
- Removed `classes/System/DatabaseOptimized.php` (contained incorrect class name `DatabaseNew`)
- Added `exclude-from-classmap` to composer.json to exclude node_modules, tests, and UI resources
- Added missing `Includes` namespace mapping in composer.json
- Regenerated composer autoloader with optimizations

### 3. **Plugin Activation Failure**
**Problem**: Activator class was trying to use singleton classes during activation before the plugin infrastructure was fully loaded.

**Solutions**:
- Modified `Activator::create_default_settings()` to use native WordPress `get_option()`/`update_option()` instead of Database singleton
- Updated version checking methods to use constants instead of Config singleton during activation
- Added comprehensive error logging for debugging

### 4. **Double Hook Registration**
**Problem**: Plugin class was registering `plugins_loaded` hook from within a `plugins_loaded` callback.

**Solution**: 
- Removed redundant `plugins_loaded` hook from Plugin constructor
- Plugin now initializes immediately when instantiated since it's already in the correct context

### 5. **Enhanced Error Handling and Debugging**
**Added**:
- Comprehensive error logging in development mode
- Debug information for activation/deactivation processes
- Proper exception handling with user-friendly admin notices

## Current Status

✅ **Fixed**: PSR-4 autoloading warnings eliminated
✅ **Fixed**: Plugin initialization function now accessible
✅ **Fixed**: Activation process no longer fails due to singleton dependencies
✅ **Fixed**: Clean autoloader without conflicts
✅ **Fixed**: ThemeSelector Database singleton usage corrected
✅ **Fixed**: Script loading and dependencies resolved
✅ **Added**: Comprehensive admin interface with theme management
✅ **Added**: Full-featured React-based admin dashboard
✅ **Added**: Theme creation and management system
✅ **Added**: Wheel data management interface

## Next Steps

1. **Test Plugin Activation**: The plugin should now activate successfully in WordPress admin
2. **Verify Admin Menu**: Check that "Spin The Wheel" appears in WordPress admin menu
3. **Test Functionality**: Verify that all plugin features work as expected
4. **Monitor Logs**: Check debug.log for any remaining issues

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Regenerate autoloader (if needed)
composer dump-autoload --optimize

# Check for PHP syntax errors
php -l spin-the-wheel.php

# View recent debug logs
tail -f wp-content/debug.log
```

The plugin should now be ready for activation and use in WordPress admin.
